# IDE Integration

IDEs work better with shims than they do environment variable modifications. The simplest way is
to add the mise shim directory to PATH.

For IntelliJ and VSCodeâ€”and likely others, you can modify `~/.zprofile`
with the following:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"
```

This won't work for all of mise's functionality. For example, arbitrary env vars in `[env]` will only be set
if a shim is executed. For this we need tighter integration with the IDE and a custom plugin. If you feel
ambitious, take a look at existing direnv extensions for your IDE and see if you can modify it to work for mise.
Direnv and mise work similarly and there should be a direnv extension that can be used as a starting point.

Alternatively, you may be able to get tighter integration with a direnv extension and using the
[`use_mise`](/direnv) direnv function.
