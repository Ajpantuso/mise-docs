# Versioning

rtx uses [Calver](https://calver.org/) versioning (`2023.6.1`).
Breaking changes will be few but when they do happen,
they will be communicated in the CLI with plenty of notice whenever possible.

Rather than have SemVer major releases to communicate change in large releases,
new functionality and changes can be opted-into with settings like `experimental = true`.
This way plugin authors and users can
test out new functionality immediately without waiting for a major release.

The numbers in Calver (YYYY.MM.RELEASE) simply represent the date of the releaseâ€”not compatibility
or how many new features were added.
Each release will be small and incremental.
